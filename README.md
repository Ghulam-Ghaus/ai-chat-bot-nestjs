## Features

- Seamless integration with OpenAI's API for natural language processing.
- Modular architecture built with NestJS for scalability and maintainability.
- Ready-to-use endpoints for interacting with the chatbot.
- Easily extendable for adding custom functionality or integrating with other services.
